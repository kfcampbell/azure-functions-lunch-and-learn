# Azure Functions Lunch and Learn

This is notes and sample code for a lunch and learn given at Alaska Airlines, 27 September 2018.

Its focus is on Azure Functions (v2, .NET Core) in an enterprise environment.

Anything clever I did was stolen from others, most notably Thiago Passos, a man far more intelligent and attractive than myself. He can be found @thiagospassos.
